                <h2>Our Website Project</h2>
                <p>Our team is working on an exciting web project that combines creativity and functionality to showcase our skills. Here's what we're building:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Preparation</p>
                        To build our website, we started by revisiting fundamental concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This initial phase involved individual practice to refresh our understanding and strengthen our foundation in web development. After gaining confidence, we established a routine, dedicating time daily to work on the website. Our team collaborated either online or through in-person meetings to ensure consistency and teamwork. Online resources, especially YouTube tutorials, were invaluable for learning and problem-solving. The most challenging aspects included grasping the box model, differentiating between margins and padding, and mastering layout properties such as position and display.</li>
                    <li><p>Practice</p>
                        With the basics in place, we transitioned to practical exercises by creating simple web pages. These exercises helped us understand the roles of HTML in structuring content, CSS in visual styling, and JavaScript in adding interactivity. This hands-on approach improved our ability to organize and arrange webpage elements systematically, making us more confident in handling real-world web design tasks.</li>
                    <li><p>Implementation</p>
                        In the implementation stage, we focused on turning our ideas into functional web pages. We started by sketching layouts to visualize the design and structure. These sketches served as a blueprint during the coding process, reducing unnecessary iterations and streamlining our workflow. By coding with clear guidance from our designs, we were able to build our pages more efficiently and with better organization.</li>
                    <li><p>Team Contributions - Schedule</p>
                        Below is a schedule of each team member's contribution during the project:
